# Commerce Discount

Commerce Discount provides a user interface for creating and managing various
types of Product and Order discounts. It lets merchants more easily configure
promotions without having to learn Rules, a core requirement for product pricing
in Commerce.

The module adds essential features to promotions through the use of a custom
entity type, including fields to configure how a discount is displayed in the
cart, usage counts, valid date ranges, and more.
